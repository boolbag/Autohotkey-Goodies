Let's Share Some Awesome Autohotkey Stuff!
==

The title says it all: the purpose of this repo is to share cool stuff for AHK, and to improve some of those tools collaboratively. Some of the themes this repo aims to cover: 

 - Tools, such as this [syntax-coloring scheme to edit AHK in EditPad Pro](https://github.com/boolbag/Autohotkey-Goodies/tree/master/Syntax%20Coloring%20Scheme%20for%20EditPad%20Pro)
 - Libraries
 - more!

## Two Ways to Participate

There are two ways to participate: the super-easy way for those who don't use `git`, and the "git way" for those who would like to collaborate actively on certain features.


### (i) The Super-Easy Way: Send a Message

Have a comment about a typo or coloring scheme but don't feel like diving into the internals?

* Click the __Issues__ button at the top of the page then the green button that says _New Issue_, or directly click this [New Issue Link](/issues/new). 
* Try to be as specific as possible, and please attach screenshots when it makes sense.


### (ii) Become a Collaborator on this Repo 

If you'd like to help improve an **existing feature**, please clone and send a pull request.
